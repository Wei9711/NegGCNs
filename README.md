# Negative Samples-enhanced Graph Convolutional Neural Networks
Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) have been generally accepted to be an effective tool for node representations learning. An interesting way to understand GCNs is to think of them as a message passing mechanism where each node updates its representation by accepting information from its neighbours (also known as positive samples). However, beyond these neighbouring nodes, graphs have a large, dark, all-but forgotten world in which we find the non-neighbouring nodes (negative samples).

This repository is the official implementation of several Negative Samples-enhanced Graph Convolutional Neural Networks, which can be run directly on Google colab.
